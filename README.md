# ObeDeep

This project aims at gathering in one place the most recent deeplearning object detection networks.
All codes should be in pure pytorch code and ready to use in order to be able to compare the outputs with ease.
## Development
- [ ] Write the first README.md
- [ ] Implement Yolov3
- [ ] Implement FasterRCNN
- [ ] Implement Retinanet
